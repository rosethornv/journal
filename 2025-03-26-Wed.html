    <h2>Yesterday, I started watching one of my Domestika courses that I mentioned on Thursday <a href="2025-03-20-Thu.html">link</a></h2>
<p>It was from Andrea Chapela - intro to writing sci-fi and fantasy. She started her career in writing at the age of 12 writing fan fiction of Harry Potter. Like for so many millennials, Harry Potter is also a huge influence of mine as well.</p>
<p>She said that because of this start in fan fic, writing for her has always been a public process and never a private one. It is meant to be shared.</p>
<p>For me, this triggered something. I don’t mind sharing my writing, but the boundary between what a person keeps personal versus shared publicly - it’s different for everyone. Every time I write on Medium, I worry about making it presentable and polished.</p>
<p>I have done a few visual art courses on Domestika and read about visual artists’ processes. I feel like visual art it is more common to be open to sharing “ugly” first attempts and the many stages of creating a finished piece. How much work it is crafting layer upon layer of artwork.</p>
<p>The process of creating written work is not quite as Instagramable. Writing and editing and rewriting is generally more of a hidden process. I suppose it doesn’t have to be. But it just doesn’t captivate people’s imagination the same way that watching an artist draw does.</p>
<p>Fan fiction forums and peer review groups and beta readers - these are all ways to get feedback. But I suppose part of the issue is that it takes much longer focus and attention for a written piece for the quality and depth to be revealed. It cannot be time-lapsed the way that a painting can.</p>
<p>For writing here in my personal space, versus writing on Medium, I can leave in all of my “I suppose”s and my crappy sentences poorly constructed sentences without shame. I suppose that this online notebook is like an artist’s sketchbook.</p>
<p>I can be honest. I can be myself. And some people won’t like me. But other people will resonate. And as a member of humanity, it is nice to find other humans who have had similar experiences. It makes us feel a sense of connection which is as important to the heart as emotional food, just as regular edible food nourishes our bodies.</p>
<p>I don’t particularly like the idea of putting this behind a paywall on Substack. For me, it makes this writing feel like dirty laundry being sold at auction to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Last night, I wanted to delete the section that I wrote yesterday in reference to my half-sister.</p>
<p>When I was in therapy, we talked about the nature of secrets. What is ok to keep a secret? What is not ok? My half-sister was/is a very controlling person. I too can be controlling in my own way. This is much of what Al-Anon and Codependency literature revolves around.</p>
<p>I think that familial relationships are much more likely to have deep issues around control versus freedom, especially in “closed family systems” which are quite tribal - very “us versus the world.” So part of that still lingers in my mind. Even though she was very cruel to me, a part of me still feels like she is still part of me and we are against the world.</p>
<p>She was a very possessive person and didn’t want me having any outside friends or relationships. She viewed virtually everyone as her enemy.</p>
<p>That narrative doesn’t work anymore though. So I haven’t deleted it.</p>
<p>When I want to write about my half-sister, it is important that it is not all about her. That’s how I lived most of my first 30 years was all about her and her feelings. I cared about her deeply but I am trying to move forward with my life. Managing this transition period is a big part of my current existence. I asked ChatGPT for a no-nonsense pep talk on this topic.</p>
<p>One of the key lines was “she is just going to be a footnote in my life.” That may well be true when I am an old woman. However, at this point, I have spent 90% of my life with her. She can hardly be relegated to a footnote just yet.</p>
