<p>Originally, I wanted this journal to be a more accurate documentation of exactly what I had seen and learned and experienced on a daily basis. However, it would seem that I don't have the personality type that would work well for such a structured approach. I am more sporadic and spontaneous.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was using Blinkist again in order to "get my money's worth" since as I said before I forgot to cancel the auto-renew. This actually turned out to be a good thing. They have a newer feature on blinkist called "Shorts" that I don't remember from last year. </p>
<p>The short that I encountered was from Mel Robbins about her 5 second rule. By simply counting down from 5, you can trigger your brain into action, away from inaction/worry. Later last night, I saw this principle in action during the NCAA basketball tournament. The announcer even said as much after a shooter drained a three, despite having a low 3Pt%. He said something like, "any shooter can do better at the end of the shot clock because they don't have to think about it."</p>
<p>After the 5 second rule short, I was inspired to listen to the blinks on Mel Robbins's The High Five Habit. This states that by giving yourself a high five every morning can improve your life. </p>
<p>A major change in my life over that past year has been following women's basketball ever since the last NCAA championship (Iowa vs. South Carolina). I watched every Indiana Fever game (not necessarily closely) which is not something I have ever done for any sports team ever in my life.</p>
<p>So, high fives and rah rah, go team has certainly been my vibe the past year. I absolutely believe in the power of the high five.</p>
<p>If anything, I view life as a cornucopia of so many potential experiences that it is frustrating to be limited in how many things I can do in a day.</p>
