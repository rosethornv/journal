<h3>Topic 1: Ken Robinson & Creativity</h3>
<p>I remembered a TED Talk by Ken Robinson on Creativity. I need to watch it again, as well as some interviews with CBS Mornings. Here are the links:</p>

<p>I wondered what he had to say about artificial intelligence. Turns out he passed away in 2020. ChatGPT had some speculation on what his views on AI might be. You can read them on this page:</p>

<h3>Topic 2: The Station Under the Cherry Blossoms</h3>
<p><a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/4026164/" target="_blank">Watch it on NHK</a></p>
<p>I saw part of this program <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/72hours/" target="_blank">Document 72 Hours</a> on NHK. It is from 2021 and will expire on June 25, 2025. There are so many interesting programs on NHK and I don't have the time to take notes and process all of them, unless I actually make the time.</p>
<p>The part that stood out to me was there was a Japanese man in his 20s or early 30s who was walking along and admiring the sakura. He said that he prefers to feast his eyes on the blossoms because they never look as beautiful when he looks at the photos he has taken. In typical self-effacing Japanese style, he posited that perhaps he just wasn't a very good photographer.</p>
<p>This triggered an ongoing "war" in my own mind about taking photographs. I love taking photos and then seeing them again later and remembering the experience. I don't find that it ruins the moment at the time and I am always happy that I have visual records of my daily life. In fact, when I forget to take photos of things I cook, etc, I am slightly mad at myself.</p>
<p>That being said, there is something very beautiful about being exclusively in the moment and soaking it up. Taking the photos presumes that you will be alive and able to access the photos again in the future. That sounds a bit dark and morbid.</p>
<p>However, it goes along with some 12 step slogans that I am working on integrating into my life. I am currently listening to How Al-Anon Works. I am on Chapter 9 and they are discussing the importance of slogans like "First Things First" and "Just For Today".</p>
<p>While Al-Anon is designed for people who have been around alcoholics and cleaning up their messes, it also is good for people who have been in dysfunctional families and adapted via becoming controlling and perfectionist. I have encountered so much wisdom in all of the 12 step fellowships that I have encountered.</p>
<p>I speculate that because of the nature of reaching the lowest of the low, moving forward from the paralysis associated with addiction of any kind brings a different type of perspective.</p>
<p>While I don't particularly resonate with Marianne Williamson at this time, in her 90's book A Return to Love, she had this excellent quote, "Until your knees finally hit the floor, you’re just playing at life, and on some level you’re scared because you know you’re just playing. The moment of surrender is not when life is over. It’s when it begins."</p>
<p>But back to the Cherry Blossoms, while they are commonly associated in the world consciousness with Japan, it is part of a larger cultural appreciation that Japan has with the changing of the seasons (as reflected with haikus, etc). Looking to nature to give us that patience and willingness to wait for things to develop and change over time.</p>
<p>One of my favorite words from Duolingo in learning Japanese is hiroi. Meaning "spacious." Duolingo used it when describing houses and apartments. So I asked ChatGPT if it could also be used to describe the natural world. Here is the response:</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>広い (hiroi)</strong> means “spacious,” “wide,” or “broad” and is not limited to homes and real estate. It can also describe natural landscapes, abstract concepts, and even someone’s mindset. Here are some contextual uses:</p>

<p><strong>1. Physical Space (Man-made & Natural)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>広い家 (hiroi ie)</strong> – a spacious house</li>
  <li><strong>広い道 (hiroi michi)</strong> – a wide road</li>
  <li><strong>広い空 (hiroi sora)</strong> – a vast sky</li>
  <li><strong>広い海 (hiroi umi)</strong> – a vast ocean</li>
  <li><strong>広い草原 (hiroi sōgen)</strong> – a wide grassland</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Abstract & Conceptual Uses</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>心が広い (kokoro ga hiroi)</strong> – someone with a generous or open-minded heart</li>
  <li><strong>視野が広い (shiya ga hiroi)</strong> – someone with a broad perspective</li>
  <li><strong>世界は広い (sekai wa hiroi)</strong> – “The world is vast,” often used metaphorically to imply there’s much to explore</li>
</ul>

<p>So yes, <strong>広い (hiroi)</strong> is often used for describing nature, as well as people’s personalities and ways of thinking.</p>

<h3>Topic 3: Jenna & Barbara Bush & Sisterhood</h3>
<p>Barbara Bush has been cohosting this week with Jenna for Today with Jenna and Friends.</p>
<p>Any time there is anything on TV (or in any media that I consume) that has something to do with sisters, I become emotionally guarded and am prone to tearing up. I don't really know how much I want to reveal about this because my heart is so tender around this topic.</p>
<p>(I also need to remember to watch for the streaming release of the movie Las Tres Sisters because I want to see it even though it is going to make me miserable. <a href="https://www.lastressistersmovie.com/" target="_blank">Las Tres Sisters</a>)</p>
<p>But much of my life until 2 years ago was built around my half-sister. She was the main person that I was codependent with. Family dysfunction is difficult to talk about because it is so immediate and personal.</p>
<p>I want to write about it because I have felt so alone in my suffering when I know that I am not. I know plenty of other people can relate to what I went through. And so if we all talk about it, we can add to the stream of bringing that suffering into the light.</p>
<p>There is the potential for a lot of anger and resentment around close family relationships. I do not want other people to hate her. I don't want to hate her. But when you spend decades of your life devoted to someone who is abusive toward you and then you finally wake up to reality, it is a shock that requires extensive processing.</p>
<p>At any rate, back to Jenna and Barbara, they are also twins. When I was growing up I desperately wanted a twin sister. Someone to always be with me. Sounds like codependency already, doesn't it? That was when I was probably 7 or 8 years old. I was jealous of the twins who went to the same school as me and was extremely enamored with Jon & Kate Plus Eight when I got older - being a multiple seemed like the perfect life for me. It seemed fun to have so many friends as siblings. In my experimental fiction writing, I have explored characters that are twins and the plot/character development opportunities that it brings.</p>
<p>It was fun to watch Jenna and Barbara and how in tune they were with each other. The way they look into each others eyes and no one else matters. It's like twin flames but even more beautiful because there is no romantic element to it. Just pure love, at least in my idealized version of twins. I realize that might sound odd. I guess I am referring to the Four Loves by CS Lewis. Here is ChatGPTs explanation on this page</p>
<p>Jenna and Barbara love calling each other Sissy still, even though they are in their early 40s. I guess viewers from yesterday were complaining about because today they were suddenly self-conscious about this habit and apologized for it. Jenna said, "I'm sorry; we're just being ourselves." Is that something that you should have to apologize for? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Anyways, the thing that made me cry was actually listening to a sample of their audiobook, <em>Sisters First</em>. It was the epigraph, a poem by Mary Oliver. This is copy and pasted from the Library of Congress:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/poetry-and-literature/poet-laureate/poet-laureate-projects/poetry-180/all-poems/item/poetry-180-133/the-summer-day/" target="_blank">Poem: The Summer Day</a></p>

<h1>Poem 133: The Summer Day</h1>
<p>Who made the world?<br/>
Who made the swan, and the black bear?<br/>
Who made the grasshopper?<br/>
This grasshopper, I mean—<br/>
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,<br/>
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,<br/>
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down—<br/>
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.<br/>
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.<br/>
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.<br/>
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br/>
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br/>
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,<br/>
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,<br/>
which is what I have been doing all day.<br/>
Tell me, what else should I have done?<br/>
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?<br/>
Tell me, what is it you plan to do<br/>
with your one wild and precious life?<br/>
—Mary Oliver (1990)</p>

<p>Hearing this poem pushed me over the edge. It was such a catharsis. In combination with the Al-Anon things I have been rereading and my desire to live my fullest life. Again that push pull of external vs internal validation.</p>
<p>What am I going to do with my one wild and previous life?</p>
<p>This poem has a strong feeling of Dead Poets Society. Also heard in the Apple iPad commercial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep2_0WHogRQ" target="_blank">Watch Commercial</a></p>
<p>“We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, "O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?" Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play <em>goes on</em> and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?”</p>
<p>And this is why I am making this website. It's a step forward to creating my own verse. It is undoubtedly imperfect and flawed. But if I don't start "putting myself out there" now, I never will.</p>
<p>And my identity, my purpose, my life, while it will still have its intrinsic meaning, I will not have expressed myself fully. If my words have the power to inspire others in even a tiny way, like those of the people I have mentioned here today, then I must share. Even if it scares me immensely.</p>
<p>It is more scary to stay silent and to live a completely voiceless life.</p>

<h2>General Notes</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I am thinking of making this more of a "notebook" rather than a "journal" since it has so many scraps of content that I consume in addition to my internal thoughts. It's more like a scrapbook of what is flowing through my mind today.</p>
<p>If anything this website project is just a way for me to track my own thoughts. And it's accountability. Because I often fall behind in my regular journal and have no reason to ever catch up. Here I know I don't have much of an audience. I know it is distinctly my space. But the fact that it is public helps me to keep going.</p>
