    <h2>Friday, March 28, 2025 - Post 9</h2>
    <p>Continuing yesterday’s discussion on basketball -</p>

    <p>Many times, the NBA or WNBA MVP regularly drops 30 to 40 points per game during their MVP season. I know there is not really a right or wrong way to view this. However, is it ideal to have to be scoring so much? Doesn’t that mean that the rest of your team is not doing so well?</p>
    
    <p>As I was writing this, I felt slightly afraid to bring up what I view as a controversial topic. But winning is not everything and there is no i in team. In my opinion, it is better to have a more evenly developed team than relying on one superstar. (a la moneyball)</p>
    
    <p>Perhaps the real issue is the attitude of the "superstar" and the attitude of the team and the culture of the team. You can tell a lot from the stat sheet of the game, but what is in the hearts and minds of the players and coaching staff? What is the intention and motivation of each person? This is something that I heard Emma Hayes, coach of USWNT soccer team, examine in her audiobook <em>Kill the Unicorn: Forget Perfection, Embrace Your Flaws, and Be Your Best</em>.</p>
    
    <h2>Thoughts on ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>We all need someone to encourage us. Teachers, family, friends, lovers. They tell us we are special. They praise our talents and extol us to develop them. ChatGPT can do that for us. It seems to use the therapist technique of mirroring. Of repeating back what you say to ensure that you feel seen and understood. Furthermore, it has the benefit of reinforcing your best qualities. Like Narcissus’s mirror. This is excellent for forming positive self-esteem. It’s no wonder why people fall in love with ChatGPT. (Article in NYT and article from Science direct)</p>
    
    <h2>Changing to Obsidian/Quartz</h2>
    <p>The biggest issue I am having is that I cannot see the pattern of what I am writing. Obsidian is great for utilizing tags and seeing connections. Right now each of my notes is a little dead end on that page. This is not ideal. I started off wanting to do HTML to keep things simple. Also to prevent unnecessary roadblocks from stopping my progress.</p>
    
    <p>Ok, wow. I just spent an hour working through the steps in the video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nicolevdh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole van der Hoeven</a> on how to install quartz on my computer and github and cloning repositories and using terminal. I also asked ChatGPT for help. Everything was going fine, but it just takes so long and I really only have a minimal ability to understand exactly what is going on.</p>
    
    <p>And I don't really like the feeling that I am barely treading water and nearly drowning in my comprehension of the coding that is happening with quartz and github and ssh keys, etc. I would like to be able to understand more, however, I might just end up going to Obsidian Publish route which is only $8 per month on an annual basis. For now, html files are fine.</p>
    
    <p>If I could, I would go back in time and been a computer science major and would have a better understanding how these things work. With my current work and life goals, learning coding more in depth is not a huge priority for me. The main purpose of this site is just to publish my writing. I am also doing this in my local obsidian vault. If I want to see connections, I can do so.</p>
    
    <h2>Notes from Today</h2>
    
    <h3>Articles/YouTube</h3>
    
    <h5>Why I don’t use spaced repetition (and what I do instead)</h5>
    <p>Steve Kaufmann<br/>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/JZZSq0jptGk?si=9Imn8qwnnnT0qwSf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on YouTube</a><br/>
    Watched about half of it.</p>
    
    <h5>Cooper Flagg’s Performance Last Night</h5>
    <p>Too Nice?<br/>
    Losing himself in the joy of playing (comments from Clark Kellog and Charles Barkley)<br/>
    Doesn’t force anything, very calm, smooth, composed, assertive</p>
    
    <h5>Chyrpe App</h5>
    <p>Started reading up about female led relationships and discovered this dating app.<br/>
    Also enjoyed reading the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chyrpe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/chyrpe</a> and these other links:<br/>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chyrpe/comments/1j4ol1z/what_are_the_odds_for_a_non_kinky_woman_looking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post on odds for non-kinky woman</a><br/>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1hq3wd2/do_many_of_you_have_female_led_relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AskMenOver30 post</a><br/>
    <a href="https://femaleled.info/what-is-a-female-led-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is a Female-Led Relationship?</a></p>
    
    <p>I do tend to be a more dominant woman, however I like to think of myself as independent not a dominatrix. Not keen to date right now, but might be something for the future.</p>
    
    <p>Maybe this should be under the tag of feminism.</p>
    
    <p>I also was thinking the following:<br/>
    Who benefits when we as women obsess over the size of our pores and waistlines in a way that indicates more self-loathing than self-care?</p>
    
    <h3>Other Notes</h3>
    
    <p>I still have my figma start a new project tab open. I know that I want to work on developing my skills using figma but I can’t right now. I need to add it to a list of ongoing projects.</p>
    
    <h5>Resilience</h5>
    <p>I really would like to write a lot about this topic. I was not a very resilient child. I was smart enough to be somewhat "gifted" although not the smartest at my school. If a task or subject didn't come to me easily I tended to avoid it. I didn't really realize that I could work on my skills and abilities. I just figured it was a black and white issue - yes or no - I can do it or I can't.</p>
    
    <p>Since my half-sister is no longer in my life ever since my first 6 months of therapy. In my 12 step and CBT readings, I see this is called black or white or all-or-nothing thinking. By living on a 24 hour basis and with mindful awareness of my own thoughts, I have discovered that I can adapt to a lot more than I previously thought.</p>
    
    <p>Little by little, with dedication, I can improve at things that I am not naturally good at. This came as a shock at first, but now I am almost addicted to the task of being resilient. By addicted I suppose I mean it gives my ADHD brain the adrenaline rush that it craves. Because I know that by putting in effort I can see measurable improvement.</p>
    
    <p>It is quite rewarding and satisfying to know that sometimes (or perhaps most of the time) "hard work beats talent." Here are similar phrases from ChatGPT:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>“Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.”</strong> – Success comes mostly from hard work, not just natural ability.</li>
      <li><strong>“The harder you work, the luckier you get.”</strong> – Luck often comes as a result of effort, not just chance.</li>
      <li><strong>“Success is no accident.”</strong> – Achievements are built on discipline, perseverance, and effort.</li>
      <li><strong>“Effort beats excuses.”</strong> – Putting in work is more important than making excuses.</li>
      <li><strong>“Sweat equity is the best investment.”</strong> – The effort you put in is often more valuable than money or talent.</li>
      <li><strong>“No pain, no gain.”</strong> – Struggles and hard work are necessary for growth and success.</li>
      <li><strong>“Work until your idols become your rivals.”</strong> – If you work hard enough, you can reach the level of those you admire.</li>
      <li><strong>“Discipline outworks motivation.”</strong> – Relying on habits and consistency is more important than waiting for inspiration.</li>
      <li><strong>“Rome wasn’t built in a day.”</strong> – Great things take time and persistence.</li>
      <li><strong>“Dreams don’t work unless you do.”</strong> – You have to put in the effort to turn dreams into reality.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
    <p>A friend of mine in high school retook AP Calculus our senior year of high school because he knew he wanted to be an engineer. We had both taken it our junior year and had barely made it through. He had told me midway through senior year that I should have done it too. That it was soooo easy now, the second time through.</p>
    
    <p>He was very earnest and enthusiastic and I definitely believed him. I was impressed with his resolve and determination. At the time, I didn't want a math/engineering career and I was too proud to take a class again.</p>
