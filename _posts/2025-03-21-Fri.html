    <h2>General Notes</h2>
<p>Accidentally auto-renewed Blinkist (forgot to cancel)</p>
<p>Today,I discovered Blinkist AI, however it costs even more money on top of what I have already regrettably paid. I don't want to buy another thing I probably won't use.</p>
<p>Started listening to the Blinks of Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams. Some of the narrators are quite annoying to my ear. </p>
<p>I need to take the time to actually read or have my screen reader read if I want to get any value from the $100 I spent.</p>

Top European brands rate Japanese textiles highly but many workshops are closing down. Miyaura Shinya shares information on the industry's superb skills as a way to revitalize manufacturing regions and forge relationships with designers. He visits factories to learn about new cloth, brings designers on visits and plans exhibitions. He also set up a course to train a new generation of potential factory workers. Miyaura's hard work helps to slow the decline of Japan's textile industry.</p>

<h2>Television</h2>
<p>watched a decent amount of the UCLA vs Southern WBB game ( 1 vs 16 seed )</p>
<p>Lunch - watched Vienna Blood S3 E2
- Aschenputtel = Cinderella
    - briefly googled = more grotesque? something about stepsisters cutting up their feet to fit the slipper. yikes.
    - flowing magical dress?
- complicated ending again. that is common with this show. 
- makes sense that it would be someone in the funeral business would be obsessed with viewing death as a "high art" 
- reminded me of the Only Murders in the Building when they would steal jewelry off of corpses and had them all hidden in the secret room. </p>
<p>Snack - finished rewatching Magpie Murders E3
- Anthony Horowitz. I honestly struggle to understand what he is saying sometimes. He talks so fast that it's hard to keep up. He is certainly passionate about murder mysteries but actually processing what he is saying is still difficult.
- End of episode 2 the clue was the Seven S's (googled = the sevens s's of crime scene investigation). This will come in handy for writing crime fiction in the future.</p>

<p>Discussed why I like diary/letters/epistolary style of reading and writing with ChatGPT. Here was the response to my question: </p>
<ul>
<li>In general, people who are drawn to diaries, journals, and letters often appreciate the ==raw, intimate, and unfiltered expression== of thoughts and emotions. </li>
<li>a direct window into ==someone’s inner world, revealing their vulnerabilities, daily struggles, and personal growth in a way that polished narratives rarely do==. </li>
<li>deep ==curiosity about human nature==, an appreciation for authenticity, and a desire to connect with another person’s lived experience on a profound level.</li>
<li>Diaries and letters give you an intimate look at ==how others process their emotions, navigate challenges, and find meaning in their lives==</li>
</ul>
