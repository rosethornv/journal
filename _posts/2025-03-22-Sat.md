**Twenty Four Hours A Day**
"The best spiritual supply is received by you when you want it to pass on to other  people. You get it largely by giving it away. ==God gives you strength as you pass it on to another person.== That strength means increased health; increased health means more good work, and more good work means more people helped. And so it goes on, a constant supply to meet all spiritual needs."  

I always like the "As Bill Sees It" readings, so I am going to start reading that book on its own.

**As Bill Sees It**  
"I can see why you are disturbed to hear some A.A. speakers say, 'A.A. is a selfish program.' The word 'selfish' ordinarily implies that one is acquisitive, demanding, and thoughtless of the welfare of others... any theologian will tell you that the salvation of his own soul is the highest vocation that a man can have... Therefore, ==our own recovery and spiritual growth have to come first--a right and necessary kind of self-concern==."
