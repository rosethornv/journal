"The best spiritual supply is received by you when you want it to pass on to other  people. You get it largely by giving it away. ==God gives you strength as you pass it on to another person.== That strength means increased health; increased health means more good work, and more good work means more people helped. And so it goes on, a constant supply to meet all spiritual needs."  </p>

Therefore, ==our own recovery and spiritual growth have to come first--a right and necessary kind of self-concern==."  </p>
