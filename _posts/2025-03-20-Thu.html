<h2>Why Share?</h2>
<p>On some level, it seems presumptuous to assume that my thoughts would be interesting to other people. In college, I said that to a friend about facebook. <em>Why should I post anything? As if people even care.</em></p>
<p>My friend said that I was being silly. She said that of course other people read everyone else's updates. They want to know what everyone else is doing, even if they don't like or comment.   </p>
<p>Then, I suppose it is my own desire for privacy that has prevented me from sharing much during my life. However, I am also a spiritual person. In most of the spiritual teachings I have read, they say that we are meant to guide each other. </p>
<p>Personally, attending various 12 step fellowships has shown me how helpful it is to hear the stories of other people going through similar life struggles.  </p>

<h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
<p>I want to write somewhere other than Medium because Medium is, in my opinion, a place ideal for more polished pieces. </p>
<p>This website/vault can be more of a scratchpad or perhaps an exploratory "playground." A place for rumination without too much polishing or over-editing. A place where I have left breadcrumbs, or perhaps puzzle pieces, that can be raw material for future, more formal work. </p>

<h2>Why Post on Medium?</h2>
<p>I have asked myself why I wanted to write and publish on Medium in the first place. I have been pondering my relationship with words, with books, etc. </p>
<p>Ever since I first started writing in a diary journal when I was maybe 8-10 years old, I always felt like I had more to write than I had the time or energy to put down. This was via writing by hand primarily. But even once I started writing via a computer, I was overwhelmed by how many words seemed to be pouring out of me. </p>
<p>All of my life, it seems, people have told me that I should be a writer. However, I am still working on what that really means for me and for my life. </p>
<p>I saw a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/the-10-year-old-medium-story-that-turned-into-a-book-deal-47fc0cdff7f3">post</a> on the Medium blog called "The 10-year-old Medium story that turned into a book deal: A reminder that you never know who’s reading your work on Medium."</p>
<p>On the surface of it, this sounds like an engaging and uplifting story. A story of the hope of being discovered. The hope of being proclaimed by the publishing world as Someone with "Something Important to Say" in the eyes of society.</p>
<p>The underlying message of such an article is that a "nobody" writer who publishes on Medium can be plucked up like a rough diamond. Once discovered, she can be polished and prettied up by corporate American institutions and suddenly become a valuable asset who is worthy of adoration. I </p>

<p>As Bill Sees It<br />
Whose Responsibility?, p. 79  </p>
<p>"An A.A. group, as such, ==cannot take on all the personal problems of<br />
its members, let alone those of nonalcoholics in the world around us.==<br />
The A.A. group is not, for example, a mediator of domestic relations,<br />
nor does it furnish personal financial aid to anyone.  </p>
<p>"Though a member may sometimes be helped in such matters by his<br />
friends in A.A., ==the primary responsibility for the solutions of all his<br />
problems of living and growing rests squarely upon the individual<br />
himself. Should an A.A. group attempt this sort of help, its<br />
effectiveness and energies would be hopelessly dissipated.  ==</p>
<p>"This is why sobriety--freedom from alcohol--through the teaching<br />
and practice of A.A.'s Twelve Steps, is the sole purpose of the group.<br />
==If we don't stick to this cardinal principle, we shall almost certainly<br />
collapse. And if we collapse we cannot help anyone.=="  </p>

<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>Briefly watched some Professional Bowling today on Fox Sports. The Chameleon Championship, won by a guy from Malaysia - Tun Hakim. I didn't see any women competing. Maybe on a different day?</p>
<p>There was also discussion of Scorpion, Shark, etc. I had to look it up. Each of these is apparently a pattern of how they oil the lane to make it more difficult.</p>
