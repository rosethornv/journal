<p>Now that I have been doing this for a week, I am beginning to see the value in either using Obsidian or a service like WordPress for organizing posts. HOWEVER, I feel it is important to not back down from my original premise and goals.</p>

<p>If I am indeed treating this like a writer's sketchbook, that means it is ok for it to be messy. I don't need to rearrange it in order for it to be acceptable. I am in the throes of giving birth to this new writing project. I don't have time to be pretty.</p>

<p>Again, the goal of this project is to get things down on paper in public. Perhaps one day, if it is published in a book format, I can rearrange it. But for now I am in the creation portion of this work, not the editing or formatting.</p>

<p>I feel very much like a donkey who keeps going off the path. I suppose I am reminded of a quote I heard from Pope Francis's book, <em>"The Name of God is Mercy"</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  "If you have a little donkey and along the road it falls onto the cobblestones, what should you do? You certainly don’t go there with a stick to beat it, poor little thing; it’s already unfortunate enough. You must take it by the halter and say: ‘Up, let’s take to the road again…Now we will get back on the road, and we will pay more attention next time.’"
</blockquote>

<p>So many times in my life so far, I have not been very patient with myself. I will instead beat myself up. I will silence myself over and over again. What kind of life is that?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Perhaps I need to write down more of my various inspirations on paper before trying to input them into here.</p>

<p>I feel like certain things resonate with each of us and perhaps it is an unconscious thing. And once we look at the pattern of the things that interest us, we can bring whatever lesson, idea, or story into the light of the conscious in order to be seen, understood, celebrated or released.</p>

<p>One story that stood out to me was Sarah Ashlee Barker of Alabama women’s basketball. She scored 45 pts trying to get her team to the next round of the tournament and the game went to double overtime and they lost. Maryland will now have to play the formidable South Carolina Gamecocks, so they will not have an easy time of it.</p>

<p>She had wanted to get back to her home court gym in Birmingham, Alabama if I remember correctly. Absolutely heartbreaking. It makes me wonder some questions.</p>
