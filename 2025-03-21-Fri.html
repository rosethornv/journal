<p>Accidentally auto-renewed Blinkist (forgot to cancel)</p>
<p>Today,I discovered Blinkist AI, however it costs even more money on top of what I have already regrettably paid. I don't want to buy another thing I probably won't use.</p>
<p>Started listening to the Blinks of Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams. Some of the narrators are quite annoying to my ear. </p>
<p>I need to take the time to actually read or have my screen reader read if I want to get any value from the $100 I spent.</p>

Top European brands rate Japanese textiles highly but many workshops are closing down. Miyaura Shinya shares information on the industry's superb skills as a way to revitalize manufacturing regions and forge relationships with designers. He visits factories to learn about new cloth, brings designers on visits and plans exhibitions. He also set up a course to train a new generation of potential factory workers.

<h2>Television</h2>
<p>watched a decent amount of the UCLA vs Southern WBB game ( 1 vs 16 seed )</p>
<p>Lunch - watched Vienna Blood S3 E2
- Aschenputtel = Cinderella
    - briefly googled = more grotesque? something about stepsisters cutting up their feet to fit the slipper. yikes.
    - flowing magical dress?
- complicated ending again. that is common with this show. 
- makes sense that it would be someone in the funeral business would be obsessed with viewing death as a "high art" 
- reminded me of the Only Murders in the Building when they would steal jewelry off of corpses and had them all hidden in the secret room. </p>
<p>Snack - finished rewatching Magpie Murders E3</p>
<p>- Anthony Horowitz. In the post show behind the scenes section, I honestly struggle to understand what he is saying sometimes. He talks so fast that it's hard to keep up. He is certainly passionate about murder mysteries but actually processing what he is saying is still difficult for me.</p>
<p>- End of episode 2 the clue was the Seven S's (googled = the sevens s's of crime scene investigation). This will come in handy for writing crime fiction in the future.</p>

<p>Learned about Boys Love and Girls Love Manga / Dramas from browsing on Viki
- asked ChatGPT about the reason for its popularity
- also about Jungian concept of Anima and Animus in terms of this phenomenon</p>
<h3>Key parts - ChatGPT Boys' Love Chat</h3>
<p>Yes, Boys’ Love (BL) is a genre of manga, anime, novels, and other media that depicts romantic and often sexual relationships between male characters. It’s primarily created by women for a female audience, though it has gained a diverse following over time.</p>
<h4><strong>Why Do Many Women Like Boys’ Love?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Freedom from Traditional Gender Expectations</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In heterosexual romance, <mark>women often face societal expectations about how they should act in relationships</mark>.</li>
  <li>BL removes these pressures because both characters are male, allowing for more equal and fluid dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safe Exploration of Sexuality</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Women can <mark>explore themes of romance and desire without projecting themselves into the narrative.</mark></li>
  <li>It allows <mark>a space for curiosity</mark> about different relationship dynamics in a way that feels <mark>less personal or threatening</mark>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Girls’ Love (GL)</strong>, also known as <strong>Yuri</strong>, is the counterpart to Boys’ Love (BL) and focuses on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female characters. Like BL, GL spans various media, including manga, anime, novels, and games.</p>
<h4><strong>Who Consumes Girls’ Love?</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Initially, GL was marketed toward men, often in a more eroticized form.</li>
  <li>Over time, a significant amount of GL media has been created <strong>by women for women</strong>, focusing on emotional depth and relationships rather than just fanservice.</li>
  <li>The audience today is diverse, including women, men, and LGBTQ+ individuals.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why Do People Like Girls’ Love?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Representation of Female Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Women who love women often find GL stories validating, even if not all stories are realistic representations.</li>
  <li>Some women who enjoy romance but <mark>dislike traditional heterosexual gender roles in fiction may find GL relationships more appealing.</mark></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Freedom from Male-Centric Perspectives</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In contrast to some traditional romance stories where female characters are written in relation to men, <mark>GL focuses on women as the center of their own narratives.</mark></li>
  <li>The relationships tend to feel more mutual rather than dictated by typical gendered romance tropes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How Does GL Compare to BL?</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>BL is <strong>more mainstream</strong> and widely consumed, while GL has had a slower rise in popularity.</li>
  <li>Historically, <strong>GL has had less industry support</strong>, though that is changing.</li>
  <li>Some argue that <strong>BL tends to be more idealized and dramatic</strong>, while <mark>GL often leans into <strong>subtlety and realism</strong></mark>—though both genres have their extremes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My question:</strong> "What do you think the role of Jung’s anima and animus have to do with all this?"</p>
<p>Carl Jung’s <strong>anima and animus</strong> concepts provide an interesting psychological lens to understand the appeal of <strong>Boys’ Love (BL) and Girls’ Love (GL)</strong>, especially their popularity among women.</p>
<h4><strong>Anima & Animus: Jung’s Theory</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Anima</strong>: The unconscious feminine side of a man.</li>
  <li><strong>Animus</strong>: The unconscious masculine side of a woman.</li>
  <li>Jung believed these aspects influence our inner world, shaping our relationships, attractions, and creative expressions.</li>
  <li>Individuation (self-development) involves integrating these unconscious aspects into conscious awareness.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>BL & Jung’s Animus</strong></h4>
<p>Many women who enjoy <strong>Boys’ Love (BL)</strong> may be engaging with their <strong>animus</strong> in a way that feels safe and freeing.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exploring Masculine Archetypes</strong>: Women may project their <strong>idealized animus</strong> onto BL characters—romanticized, emotionally expressive men who engage in relationships free from societal constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Emotional Connection Over Gender Norms</strong>: BL often presents men as deeply emotional and vulnerable, bypassing rigid gender roles.</li>
  <li><strong>Romance Without Self-Projection</strong>: Since both characters are male, there’s no direct female presence, allowing women to engage in romance <strong>without self-identification or societal baggage</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>GL & Jung’s Anima</strong></h4>
<p>Women who resonate with <strong>Girls’ Love (GL)</strong> may be exploring their <strong>anima</strong>—their own feminine depths and relational dynamics.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A Journey into Feminine Expression</strong>: GL stories often highlight deep emotional bonds, intimacy, and self-discovery, aligning with the <strong>anima’s</strong> role in self-awareness.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe Space for Emotional Exploration</strong>: Women may explore female relationships in a way that feels validating, whether they identify as LGBTQ+ or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflection of the Inner Feminine</strong>: GL often captures themes of self-acceptance, vulnerability, and connection, which can be part of integrating one’s own anima.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>A Broader View: Anima, Animus & Androgyny</strong></h4>
<p>Jung suggested that true individuation involves <strong>harmonizing both anima and animus</strong>, moving toward an <strong>androgynous psyche</strong>—one that fully integrates both masculine and feminine elements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>BL and GL can be seen as cultural expressions of this <strong>integration</strong>, allowing audiences to explore different aspects of gender, love, and self-identity.</li>
  <li>The <strong>rising popularity</strong> of these genres may reflect a societal shift <strong>away from rigid gender roles</strong> and toward a more fluid understanding of love and identity.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h4>
<p>BL and GL offer unique ways for people—especially women—to explore and integrate their inner masculine and feminine energies <strong>without real-world constraints</strong>. Whether consciously or unconsciously, these genres may serve as a form of psychological self-exploration and individuation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Discussed why I like diary/letters/epistolary style of reading and writing with ChatGPT. Here was the response to my question: </p>
<ul>
    <li>People who are drawn to diaries, journals, and letters often appreciate the <mark>raw, intimate, and unfiltered expression</mark> of thoughts and emotions.</li>
    <li>A direct window into <mark>someone’s inner world, revealing their vulnerabilities, daily struggles, and personal growth in a way that polished narratives rarely do</mark>.</li>
    <li>Deep <mark>curiosity about human nature</mark>, an appreciation for authenticity, and a desire to connect with another person’s lived experience on a profound level.</li>
    <li>Diaries and letters give you an intimate look at <mark>how others process their emotions, navigate challenges, and find meaning in their lives</mark>.</li>
  </ul>
