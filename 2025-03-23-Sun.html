  <h2>Why this format?</h2>
  <p>So continuing yesterday's note on Obsidian versus HTML, I am going to continue this journal/blog on my own Obsidian, but convert it to HTML using ChatGPT.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, I used a python script in order to convert my markdown files from Obsidian, however, I don't think it really formatted the way that I wanted it to.</p>
  <p>That's the thing about automation and artificial intelligence in general. There are still so many little things that a human still has to do. It is neither as perfect nor as evil as we project onto it. But it certainly has elements of both great potential harm or potential help, like Pandora's Box. They are still tools, perhaps the most powerful tools ever created so far, but they need direction in order to create.</p>
