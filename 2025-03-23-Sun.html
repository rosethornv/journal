  <h2>Why this format?</h2>
  <p>So continuing <a href="2025-03-22-Sat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yesterday's note</a> on Obsidian versus HTML, I am going to continue this journal/blog on my own Obsidian, but convert it to HTML using ChatGPT.</p>
  <p>Yesterday, I used a python script in order to convert my markdown files from Obsidian, however, I don't think it really formatted the way that I wanted it to.</p>
  <p>That's the thing about automation and artificial intelligence in general. There are still so many little things that a human still has to do. It is neither as perfect nor as evil as we project onto it. But it certainly has elements of both great potential harm or potential help, like Pandora's Box. They are still tools, perhaps the most powerful tools ever created so far, but they need direction in order to create.</p>
  <p>The reason why I switched to HTML was that I want to improve my coding skills. Yesterday, I watched a video from Elsa Scola called 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/ujPDRl1q-dw?si=6NSKsqPL4q7isP-E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coding was HARD Until I Learned These 5 Things</a>.
    It was an interesting video that is certainly worth a watch. The key point that I agreed with in my own coding experience is "4. Prioritize Understanding".
  </p>
  <p>I created an HTML website in elementary school 20+ years ago. I understood the basics of HTML, but I still felt very intimidated by how to get the files on to the internet (i.e. put on a server). I have had 10+ blogs over the years, on WordPress primarily.</p>
  <p>Going through the process of picking out the perfect theme, then starting to put up posts, then getting anxious about comments. For me, the whole thing has largely been marked by self-doubt and self-deletion.</p>
  <p>Last year, I discovered Obsidian from a YouTube video about the Zettelkasten note-taking system. This led me to videos by 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nicolevdh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole van der Hoeven</a>, and as I followed her tutorials, which sometimes included some fancy tech stuff I had never attempted before, I began to wonder if perhaps I could actually do coding things.
  </p>
  <p>Recently, I almost signed up for a $10K coding bootcamp. However, I wasn't really that motivated to do it because it is extremely easy to find free or low-cost coding resources online these days. I think the only reason I was tempted was because of that impulse within me to seem "legitimate."</p>
  <p>This is something I discussed in my Medium article 
    <a href="https://medium.com/@rosethornvexley/being-crazy-will-banish-your-ego-free-your-spirit-20cc32cac0cc?sk=d9b9a75f5450a4d05a71ae471e8b0edf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Being “Crazy” Will Banish Your Ego & Free Your Spirit</a>.
    I do wonder how long I will live with this constant pull between external validation and internal validation. However, I suppose this journal is an attempt to honor my own voice more.
  </p>
  <p>Looking at what I have published so far, again I am slightly horrified at all of the words. This is exactly why I don't publish it directly to Medium. Not to mention all of the processing between external texts (articles, videos, ChatGPT chats, etc) which are not my words and therefore getting paid for them makes me feel guilty.</p>
  <p>However, when I try to interact with my notes on Obsidian or even in my own journals, I have a tendency to become too tangled up in my own perfectionism. By putting these notes up on my GitHub Pages site, I am practicing in public — a concept that I learned to appreciate from videos by Nicole van der Hoeven.</p>
  <p>I fear I have gotten off topic a bit. I wanted this HTML site because as I have played around with coding, I have been creating a sort of patchwork of knowledge, but I've really just been playing around. I have refused to commit.</p>
  <p>In general in my life, I struggle with commitment. I primarily attribute that to my ADHD, but also some to me being an "adult child" as defined by Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families.</p>
  <p>At any rate, I chose to this method of creating an online journal that is also a way to practice my coding skills, using Visual Studio code and Github Desktop to become more comfortable in a space that is both private and public.</p>
  <p>It is kind of funny that everytime I update my files, I have to hit the commit to main button. It feels like I am committing to my own voice and my own future with teeny tiny steps. According to most mental health resources, it seems small steps are the only way to go.</p>
